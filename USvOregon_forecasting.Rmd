# Overview of system(s) being managed:	US v Oregon(Hannah)

## Management agreement governing salmon harvest by Washington, Oregon and 4 Treaty Tribes

##	Management stocks

-	Spring Chinook, summer Chinook, sockeye, steelhead (H & W * A & B), Fall Chinooks stocks (several)
-	Harvest control rules

# Do you use your results to make management decisions? (Hannah)

##	Pre-season plannings
## In-season management
##	Post-season assessment

# Current approach to forecasting (Mark)

## What data are available/used? 

-	Response = run reconstruction output
    - Example: of a run reconstruction: Spring Chinook = Adult Bonneville counts Jan 1 â€“ June 15 + Lower River harvest
- age composition date
-	Inseason dam counts
-	River flow (for inseason model)
-	Other environmental covariates available but not used  much currently

## What type of analyses do you conduct? (Mark)
	
- Sibling regression with dynamic linear models and model averaging
-	x-year averages (e.g., 5-year or 10 year)
-	Occasionally will look at other things


# How good do they do? (forecast accuracy summary or simple statement of current problems) (Mark & Hannah)

## Plot of actual vs forecast 

## Joint likelihood inseason model plot example


# What would most help you in improving future forecasts?

## General challenges (Hannah)

-	Environmental covariates
    -	Which ones?
    -	Matching covariates with habitat use of stock in space and time
        - What do we know about where fish are and when, and what affects their survival
    -	How to incorporate?
        -	Variable selection, regularization, etc. (optional)
